# SUAMI-REU-2017
This work stems from my teams effort in the 2017 SUAMI REU seen here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/zyxvpcwdwkwx. The titles are unintuitive, and I'll fix them soon. (I'm speed-running my GitHub so it's moderately complete for my job search). If I recall correctly each script web-scrapes data and manages calculations of the securities/derivatives.
